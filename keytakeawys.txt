Project Summary: R Stock Risk Analyzer

Overview:
The R Stock Risk Analyzer is a full-stack, data-driven web application designed to analyze and visualize the risk profile of individual stocks using real-time financial data. The project demonstrates the integration of R for backend analytics, secure API management, robust error handling, and the application of key financial risk metrics.

Key Technical Skills & Knowledge

1. Full-Stack R Application Development:
- Skill: Developed a complete web application, handling both backend (server-side logic and data processing) and frontend (user interface and interactivity).
- Backend: Utilized the plumber package in R to create a RESTful API. Plumber allows R functions to be exposed as HTTP endpoints, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend. This approach is similar to using Flask or FastAPI in Python, but leverages R’s statistical capabilities.
- Frontend: Built with HTML for structure, Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior. The JavaScript fetch API was used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to the R backend, enabling real-time data updates without page reloads.

2. API Integration and Troubleshooting:
- Skill: Integrated with a live, third-party financial data provider (Alpha Vantage) to fetch up-to-date stock and market data.
- Tools Used: Employed the httr2 package in R for constructing and executing HTTP requests, handling authentication, and parsing JSON responses.
- Knowledge Gained: Learned to navigate real-world API challenges, such as:
    - Understanding and respecting API rate limits to avoid service interruptions.
    - Managing invalid or expired API keys and providing clear error messages.
    - Adapting to API endpoint limitations (e.g., discovering that TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED is a premium feature and switching to TIME_SERIES_DAILY for free access).
    - Implementing fallback mechanisms and user notifications for API-related issues.

3. Secure API Key Management:
- Skill: Adopted industry best practices for handling sensitive credentials.
- Approach: Stored API keys in a .Renviron file, which is loaded by R at startup. This keeps secrets out of source code and version control, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
- Implementation: Accessed the API key in R using Sys.getenv(), ensuring that credentials remain secure and are never hard-coded or shared publicly.

4. Robust Error Handling:
- Skill: Built resilience into both backend and frontend to handle unexpected failures gracefully.
- Backend (R): Wrapped critical code blocks in tryCatch() to intercept errors during API calls, data processing, or calculations. Returned informative error messages to the frontend, preventing server crashes and aiding debugging.
- Frontend (JavaScript): Used try...catch with fetch to handle failed HTTP requests or server errors. Displayed user-friendly error messages in the UI, improving the overall user experience.

Key Analytical Skills & Financial Math

1. Understanding Financial Risk Metrics:
- Volatility: Quantifies the degree of variation in a stock’s price over time. High volatility indicates larger price swings and higher risk, while low volatility suggests more stable prices.
- Beta: Measures a stock’s sensitivity to market movements. A beta greater than 1 means the stock is more volatile than the market; less than 1 means it is less volatile. Beta helps investors understand how a stock might react to overall market changes.

2. Mathematical Foundations and Calculations:
- Daily Returns: Calculated as the percentage change in price from one trading day to the next.
    - Formula: $$ \text{Return}_t = \frac{\text{Price}_t}{\text{Price}_{t-1}} - 1 $$
    - Where $\text{Price}_t$ is today’s closing price and $\text{Price}_{t-1}$ is the previous day’s closing price.
- Annualized Volatility: Converts daily volatility to an annual figure, accounting for the typical number of trading days in a year (252).
    - Process:
        - Compute the standard deviation ($\sigma_{\text{daily}}$) of daily returns.
        - Multiply by $\sqrt{252}$ to annualize.
    - Formula: $$ \text{Annualized Volatility} = \sigma_{\text{daily}} \times \sqrt{252} $$
- Beta (β): Assesses the systematic risk of a stock relative to the market.
    - Process:
        - Calculate the covariance between the stock’s daily returns and the market’s (e.g., QQQ ETF) daily returns.
        - Calculate the variance of the market’s daily returns.
        - Divide covariance by variance to obtain beta.
    - Formula: $$ \beta = \frac{\text{Covariance}(\text{Stock Returns, Market Returns})}{\text{Variance}(\text{Market Returns})} $$

3. Practical Application:
- The application fetches historical price data for both the selected stock and a market benchmark (QQQ).
- Computes daily returns for both series.
- Calculates annualized volatility and beta, providing users with clear, actionable insights into the risk characteristics of their chosen stock.
- Presents results in an intuitive web interface, with clear explanations and error handling for data or connectivity issues.

Summary:
This project provided hands-on experience in building a secure, robust, and user-friendly financial analytics tool using R and modern web technologies. It deepened understanding of API integration, secure credential management, error handling, and the practical application of financial risk metrics.
