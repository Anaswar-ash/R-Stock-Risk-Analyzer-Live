Based on the final state of the R Stock Risk Analyzer project, here’s a clear summary of the key skills, knowledge, and financial formulas used.

## Key Technical Skills & Knowledge

This project was a full journey in building a data-driven web app using R.

### 1. Full-Stack R Application Development
- **What you learned:** How to build both the backend (server logic) and frontend (user interface).
- **Tools:**
    - **Backend:** Used the `plumber` R package to create a web server and REST API (like Flask/FastAPI in Python).
    - **Frontend:** Used HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Learned how JavaScript’s `fetch` talks to the R backend.

### 2. API Integration and Troubleshooting
- **What you learned:** How to connect to a live web API for real-time data.
- **Tools:** Used the `httr2` R package to make HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Key lesson:** Learned to handle real-world API issues, like:
    - API rate limits
    - Invalid API keys
    - Some endpoints (like `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED`) require a paid plan, so you switched to a free one (`TIME_SERIES_DAILY`).

### 3. Secure API Key Management
- **What you learned:** How to keep sensitive info (like API keys) safe.
- **Best practice:** Never put secrets directly in your code. Instead, store them in a `.Renviron` file (read by R at startup), and access them with `Sys.getenv()`. This keeps your keys out of GitHub.

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- **What you learned:** How to make your app handle errors gracefully.
- **Tools:**
    - **Backend (R):** Used `tryCatch()` to catch errors and send helpful messages to the frontend.
    - **Frontend (JavaScript):** Used `try...catch` with `fetch` to show errors to the user instead of crashing.

## Key Analytical Skills & Financial Math

You applied core statistics to measure financial risk.

### 1. Understanding Financial Risk Metrics

- **Volatility:** Measures how much a stock’s price moves up and down. High volatility = bigger swings = higher risk.
- **Beta:** Measures how much a stock moves compared to the market. 
    - Beta > 1: Stock is more volatile than the market.
    - Beta < 1: Stock is less volatile than the market.

### 2. The Formulas and What They Mean

#### Daily Returns

- **What it is:** The percent change in price from one day to the next.
- **Formula:**  
    Return for day t = (Price on day t / Price on day t-1) - 1  
    Example:  
    If yesterday’s price was $100 and today’s is $102:  
    Return = (102 / 100) - 1 = 0.02 (or 2%)

#### Annualized Volatility

- **What it is:** How much the price typically fluctuates in a year.
- **How to calculate:**
    1. Find the standard deviation of daily returns (this is the average daily fluctuation).
    2. Multiply by the square root of 252 (about the number of trading days in a year).
- **Formula:**  
    Annualized Volatility = (Standard deviation of daily returns) × √252  
    Example:  
    If daily standard deviation is 1.5%:  
    Annualized Volatility = 0.015 × 15.87 ≈ 0.238 (or 23.8% per year)

#### Beta

- **What it is:** How much the stock’s returns move compared to the market’s returns.
- **How to calculate:**
    1. Calculate the covariance between the stock’s daily returns and the market’s daily returns (how much they move together).
    2. Calculate the variance of the market’s daily returns (how much the market moves on its own).
    3. Beta = Covariance / Variance
- **Formula:**  
    Beta = Covariance(Stock Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)  
    Example:  
    If covariance is 0.0008 and variance is 0.0005:  
    Beta = 0.0008 / 0.0005 = 1.6
